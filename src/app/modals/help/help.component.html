      First off, gather 4 other friends at the LEAST (4 players & 1 host). This game is meant to be heavily moderated,
      so make sure your host is up for the task!
      <br>
      Whoever the host will be should click start game then distribute the room code to all other players.
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The game consists of a chosen number of questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a question appears, nobody is given the answer except for the host & The Liar.
        </li>
        <li>
          After a set amount of questions there will be a voting round where everyone votes on who to vote out. EXCEPT,
          their
          votes don't really matter..<br>
          The Liar's vote is all that counts.
        </li>
        <li>
          When only 3 players remain (1 being The Liar), the table has to decide who The Liar is. If they get it
          right; the other two players win.
          If they get it wrong, The Liar is the sole victor!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      This game is meant to be fast paced, so keep the player count relatively low.
      <br>
      The trivia also ranges from easy to hard, enjoy and keep your eyes and ears open for any sign of The Liar!
